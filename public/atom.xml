    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello old friends.  Hello new friends.  Hello colleagues.  Hello young learners.  Hello respected professionals.  I am the GeekyMamaMare.  Welcome to my blog.</p>

<p>Please enjoy sharing my journey of re-discovering my passion in technology and re-directing (re-purposing?) my career from software testing to software development.  A wordy intro statement indeed, but very relevant to my journey as you will see in time.  Let&rsquo;s start by looking at the dilemna I found myself in.</p>

<p>I had been a quality engineer in the computer industry for 20 years, when, in the summer of 2011, my dream job fell through my hands.  I was devastated.  I quickly realized that I was far too emotionally fragile for the moment and needed to take some time away from the industry to recover from my heart ache.</p>

<p>A year passed and I refreshed my resume and leapt back into the job search.  I had been fortunate in the past that each job came along just as it was needed, usually through networking, and generally right along the lines of where I wanted my career to go.  This time it was a different experience.  None of the jobs available seemed to be a good fit for my skills or my experience.  I also was beginning to discover a lack of motivation in my search.  It was as if my passion for technology and computers was missing.</p>

<p>I took a bit of time to figure out my priorities and what made me eager to go to work in the morning, only to discover that I really wasn&rsquo;t seeing anything available in the job market that made me eager to leave my family, my son, my ranch, and my horses in the morning.</p>

<p>My new goals started to come clear.</p>

<p>I wanted to renew my passion for technology such that I could find a company to contribute to that made me as eager to head to the office in the morning as I was to return to my beloved ranch in the evening.</p>

<p>Ok, good goal.  Now to develop a plan to take me towards that goal.</p>

    <id>http://geekymamamare.com/blog/2014/04/25/who-am-i</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To make a goal, I find it important to know who you are, why you are that way, and what is important to you.</p>

<p>The most important aspects of my life all fall into three categories.  My horses, my family, and my geekiness.  Everything I do in life ties into at least one of these.  That is the TL;DR version.  To learn more about me and what I find most important, read on.</p>

<h3>Horses</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been involved with horses my entire life.  They inspire me.  I love them deeply and their presence in my life is one of the foundations of my happiness and life satisfaction.  After hoping and planning from my early to mid-teens, I finally have my dream ranch and my horse breeding program.  I am working toward breeding honest, clever, and well-moving young horses that will, I hope, become that long sought after equine partner for the aspiring rider looking for just the right equine friend.  A challenging goal.  Intelligent horses can be a wonderful challenge to raise, but very rewarding as well.  My careful breeding choices are taking care of the intelligence and athleticism.  The daily focus of to raise and train up the youngsters in a loving but disciplined environment to produce and nurture their good and willing nature.</p>

<h3>Family</h3>

<p>I am blessed with a wonderful family.  Most of all, by my son.  I am absolutely biased as any mother would be.  I find my son to be beautiful, very bright, energetic, loving and kind, gentle, a great adventuring partner, and a delight to watch learn and grow.  I am also incredibly lucky in that he seems to share my love of horses and things geeky.  I felt like I won the baby lottery when he was born back in 2009 and have felt that even more so as the years pass.  Certainly, he goes through the various challenges and foibles of every youngster, but I still feel like we have an easier time of it than most, and am very grateful to be so blessed.  I am also fortunate, especially in this journey of re-discovery, to have an understanding and supportive family.  It can be very difficult to change a career in midlife, especially with all the learning, studying, and growing that are involved in that process.  They were very worried about me as I realized I&rsquo;d lost my passion in technology.  And now they are encouraging, patient, and supportive as I learn and grow.  It can be very hard for the family at such a time.  I am so glad that they are behind me all the way.  I am very lucky.  I could be making these changes without their support.</p>

<h3>My geeky history</h3>

<p>In some ways, I was very sheltered while growing up in California&rsquo;s San Joaquin valley.  I had my horses, my books, a few friends, and a hugely active imagination.  I was mostly busy in my own world of pretend, but not too much so.  I was an adequate student without trying.  I was somewhat social as well as somewhat athletic.  I was also a voracious reader.  This last was probably what led me to declare myself &ldquo;weird&rdquo; in ninth grade.  I&rsquo;m not sure what I was going for at the time, but in hindsight, I was very right.  It was hard to be interested in elclectic, odd, and alternative things in the area where I grew up, since mainstream culture was almost all that was available.  But libraries were a good friend to me and my active imagination combined with new ideas and worlds and creatures from books allowed me to explore my &ldquo;weirdness&rdquo; or what I now call my geekiness.  As an adult, I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and eventually to Santa Cruz where I found many other geeky people and interests to pursue.  I discovered Sci Fi/Fantasy conventions, the SCA, gaming, electronics, and so much more.  I worked hard at the local community college getting my core classes out of the way, then transferred to UC Santa Cruz, where I discovered that instead of majoring in programming, I could major in computer engineering, playing with chips, resistors, capacitors, and wiring, while taking programming classes as upper division electives.  So much fun!</p>

<h3>My career so far</h3>

<p>When just beginning my career with computers, there was a huge hiring freeze all through Silicon Valley.  This made finding a programming job very difficult for someone still in college.  I got an opportunity, but it started me on the path of software testing instead of programming.  I was initially a little unsatisfied, but eventually grew to love breaking software.  This satisfied me for a long while.  But eventually it was not enough.  I eventually landed my dream job in testing.  I was working with a product that I respected, with technology I enjoyed, with colleagues that were fun and challenging to work with, creating a product that was making a real difference in the world.  But it was a very small company.  And small companies must grow.  And when small companies grow, they change.  And often, those changes create a culture and a company mission that was not what it once was.  Parting with my dream job in the end was painful and made me quesion myself, my abilities, and my passion in technology entirely.  I spent that next year pursuing interests around my family and my horses in order to recover, since I was in no condition to market myself to a new company.  I eventually found my balance again, updated and polished up the ole resume, and dove into the job search.  I was ready to return to work.  I thought.  But as the weeks and then months passed, none of the job listings seemed right.  They were looking for skills I neither had nor wanted, or were working on things that held no interest.  I felt my passion for technology falling to the wayside, in the face of the drab, the mundane, the stultifying.  It was a low moment indeed.</p>

<p>Thus begins my journey.</p>

    <id>http://geekymamamare.com/blog/2014/04/20/what-do-i-want</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An old friend from my old Santa Cruz days visited over Thanksgiving, 2012.  I was pretty uncomfortable in my own skin at the time and had been been feeling like I didn&rsquo;t have anyone I felt like I could turn to.</p>

<p>Turning to others is hard</p>

<p>You see, I&rsquo;m a very strong personality.  Small surprise there, I know.  But what this ends up meaning is that for all I seem very strong and able on the outside, I have a lot of doubt and weakness on the inside.  I feel like so many people look up to me (I still am perplexed by this), but none of them feel to me like they are strong enough and have the perpective to be someone I can lean one and turn to when I&rsquo;m feeling week and in need of someone who sees me as just a person.  Sees me with my faults and foibles, but loves me deeply and so can give me that support that only a friend who has known you for many years can give you.  The kind of support that sometimes involves a boot in the arse.  Thank you, dear Kallie.</p>

<p>She reminded me of the things I find important.  And that my weakness was part of my strength and definitely part of my appeal.  She showed me the beginnings of the support that women can give one another.  And I started to discover some of the strength found from the support of other engineering women.  She reminded me, through many delightfully geeky conversations of my love for engineering, right down to the ones and zeros of circuit design.  To be sure I&rsquo;d learned the lesson, this valued friend sent me a LED clock engineering kit for my birthday in the beginning of 2013.  It wasn&rsquo;t very long before I took the time to start soldering the pieces of that clock.  So. Much. Fun.</p>

<p>Hey.  There it is.  My joy in engineering.  Still there, without a doubt.</p>

<p>OK, so now what&hellip;?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First, some history to know where I come from, technologically.</p>

<h3>Programming</h3>

<p>I discovered a passion for computers in a programming class I took in high school.  I gradual route through post-high school education finally took me to the University of California at Santa Cruz.  I initally planned to major in Computer Science, but when I discovered that they had a Computer Engineering progam when I could learn all about the hardware and still take programming classes as my upper division electives, I knew I&rsquo;d found the right program for me.  Years of hard work later saw me successfully graduated and employed in the computer industry as a software tester.</p>

<h3>Whoops, a job in test!</h3>

<p>I had initially planned to become a developer, but landed my first industry job at a startup that needed a tester immediately and I was the only one in their list willing to come in the very next day, a Saturday.  Yes, I had social plans, but the opportunity was not to be missed.</p>

<h3>Quality Engineering</h3>

<p>Several industry quality engineering positions later, I decided that I very much liked testing, as long as I was working very closely with the development process.  I wanted to be in on the design decisions and debug the specs (specifications) before they were implemented and it was too late.</p>

<p>Slowly the industry changed, turning quality engineers into SDETs and requiring automation of monolithic systems where it is hard to feel like your testing, your coding, or your opinions matter much.  I&rsquo;ve managed to avoid this side of the industry until now.  But now, it seems to be the standard.  Another failed SDET interview in February seems to confirm this.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>March 28-31st, 2013</p>

<p>Spring brought with it the local literary convention, NorWesCon.  There were several panels that got me thinking about women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math), networking within my industry, and how to re-find my passion in technology.  I decided it was time to pick back up my long abandoned pursuit of programming and to start networking with other women in technology for mutual support and growth.</p>

<p>Most of my social connections previously have been with men, so networking with women is a frightening notion for me.  I have long shied away from Ladies Nights Out as being very foreign and uncomfortable and not very applicable.  But, I needed to get out more and freshen my networking skills as a preparation for interviewing so I time to plunge forward right outside my comfort zone.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>April 11th, 2013</p>

<p>This was the first in my networking event line up.  A meetup for the purpose of networking with other geeky women.  It seemed like a good first step to get me started on networking.  I was very nervous going into this, since this sort of thing is way outside of my comfort zone.  Ok, deep breath, I can do this.</p>

<p>It turned out that these are good and friendly folk.  We were all mostly new, but that helped somewhat.  I introduced myself to a number of folks and worked on those introduction sorts of conversations.  Some were more successful that others.  I&rsquo;m glad I went.  This was a good training event in how to network.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I chose a couple of venues to start with, both online and in person.</p>

<h3>DevChix</h3>

<p>Online, there is DevChix.  This is a women&rsquo;s only group where I find women encouraging other women in technology, talking to each other about various social or technical challenges in the industry, and almost anything else a woman who programs might like to discuss.  I highly recommend this Google group.</p>

<h3>CodeChix</h3>

<p>I must give a huge shout out to Shaili Guru of the Seattle chapter of CodeChix.  I started out just attending a little C# introduction held at the library.  I have since attended a number of events held by CodeChix and have had my best networking experiences there.  I&rsquo;ve also met some of my favorite companies with whom I later enjoyed excellent interviews at CodeChix events.  This group seems mostly based in Silicon Valley, with a good chapter in Seattle, a website, and meetup groups by city.</p>

<h3>Women Who Code, Seattle</h3>

<p>This international group started in 2011 and has been spreading.  The Seattle chapter started in November 2013 and already is approaching 400 members.  Such a neat experience walking into a room of 60 women, all of whom write code.  They have a website, a newsletter, and meetup groups by city.  I&rsquo;ve found the newsletter very useful to discover events I haven&rsquo;t found anywhere else, such as one of Google&rsquo;s Women in Technology events.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I remembered a nudge towards Ruby Koans that I&rsquo;d been given by a friend and colleague a couple years back and so worked my way through the koans again.  A very good reminder of the fun I had exploring this new language and how easy thing were to implement in Ruby.  Ruby doesn&rsquo;t have the pain of memory allocation and pointers and string manipulation pain.  This seemed like something to investigate further, so I did a bit of research investigating online learning resources for Ruby.</p>

<p>I found CodeAcademy and spent most of April and May working my way through thier Ruby, JavaScript, and JQuery offerings.  Their lessons are pretty basic introductions, but are a fun introduction and free.  I hadn&rsquo;t really meant to do the JS and JQuery lessons, but the Ruby lessons were broken for a while.  I enjoyed the gamification of the coding lessons, where I could earn a personal high score in Points Today, Day Streak, Total Points, and Badges Completed.</p>

<p>I was rapidly starting to believe that Ruby on Rails may well be a good and enjoyable start along my path towards my goal.</p>

<p>The Seattle Rails educational and networking meetup was an evening-long event with two technical talks, dinner, and networking.  I was pretty nervous going into this, since my programming skills are rusty at best, and I am completely new to Ruby.</p>

<p>The Seattle Rails community was <em>very</em> welcoming.  I felt encouraged and came away eager to continue forward learning Ruby and Rails as well as networking with folks in that community.  &ldquo;Matz is nice, so we are nice.&rdquo;  This is a phrase I learned at this event referring to the ruby language designer,  Mr. Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz).  Seems very true.  Looking forward to becomming a part of this community.</p>

    <id>http://geekymamamare.com/blog/2014/03/10/shes-geeky</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>April 26th &amp; 27th, 2013</p>

<p>I joined several relevent local meetup groups and then I learned of She&rsquo;s Geeky 13, Seattle.  This is an un-conference for women geeks of all kinds to share, connect, network, learn, inspire, and enjoy (paraphrased from the She&rsquo;s Geeky website, shesgeeky.org).</p>

<h3>Impostor Syndrome</h3>

<p>I enjoyed panels on public speaking, mentoring, Ruby and online learning, and very importantly for me: Impostor Syndrome.  Oh that last one was an eye opener for me to be sure.  It explains a lot to me about why so many women in technology have a hard time putting themselves forward unless or until they are very sure of themselves.  It is very reassuring to me to know how many suffer from this and not all of them women either.</p>

<h3>A plan</h3>

<p>Attending this un-conference made all the difference in the world and confirmed the wisdom of my ideas.  I finalized my plan for re-purposing my career with the attendant studying, learning, networking needed over the next several months to change my career from being a 20 year software tester, to being a newby Ruby on Rails developer.</p>

<h3>A journey</h3>

<p>I came out of this experience realizing that I was on an amazing journey.  I also realized the importance of sharing my travels so that other people, particularly women, could see a path that could be taken, and that great change can be made by normal people.  Thanks to some encouragement I received during She&rsquo;s Geeky I saw the wisdom of writing about my experience, thus I first put &ldquo;pen&rdquo; to this blog of my journey on May 8, 2013.</p>

<p>Thank you, She&rsquo;s Geeky, for the inspiration, the encouragement, and the courage to give it all a try.  I can&rsquo;t wait until next time!</p>

    <id>http://geekymamamare.com/blog/2014/03/05/railstutorial</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The month of May found me finishing up CodeAcademy and looking for something new.</p>

<p>Remembering some advice from the Seattle Rails event, I looked into Michael Hartl&rsquo;s online RailsTutorial.  I&rsquo;d been learning Ruby all this time, which is a programming language.  A particularly high level and weakly typed language.  Rails is a framework that is written in Ruby.  What I had not realized before now is that I&rsquo;d been using Rails back at my last job and so was already rather familiar with it.</p>

<p>I also started my GitHub repository as a result of working through RailsTutorial.  I had no idea at the time just how important and heavily used that repo would become.  It makes me smile, looking back.</p>

<p>I took about 2 months to work through RailsTutorial.  I really took my time so I would fully understand things as well as trying to work through the various exercises.  I first became familiar with StackOverflow at this time, since occasionally, syntax changes in newer versions of Ruby/Rails would cause proplems.  Goodness have I ended up becoming familiar with Stack Overflow over the last year as a Go To place for finding solutions to problems.  So far, I haven&rsquo;t answered a question nor posed a question of my own.  Impostor Syndrome or perfectionism has kept me from doing it so far as I want to be sure to get it just right.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>July 17-21, 2013</p>

<p>Something I haven&rsquo;t been mentioning too much yet is the importance of taking time for yourself and for your family.  It can be a lot of effort in logistics and preparation, but going away with my family and putting most of our every day responsibilities aside for a time can be a wonderful way to relax and reconnect.</p>

<p>Some of the family is involved in a martial art.  The art has a summer camp every year that is an extended weekend campout at a beautiful lake on the Olympic peninsula.  The participants organize into little workshops or hikes on the days leading up to the last day when all gather for the summer Belt Test.</p>

<p>I am fortunate that this is an event that is looked forward to by the whole family.  We keep it pretty civilized though by staying in an RV.  We like our hot showers and easy cooking facilities, not to mention the espresso machine and power for our devices.  I mean really, how would I blog without power?  Still, much of the time is spent together around the campfire, swimming, hiking, or playing games.</p>

<p>The weather was lovely.  The company was good.  Swimming in the lake was divine.  Our little boy had such a good time, with a possible exception of one late night when his tummy decided ENOUGH!.  Ah well, I managed to get Everything cleaned up in the Rented RV after only 2 or 3 hours.  Poor little guy.  Poor mama.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>July 26th, 2013</p>

<p>Who are these Code Fellows anyway?</p>

<p>Not sure where I found these folks initially.  I think I just kept stumbling over the name over and over.  It seemed like a rigorous but awesome solution to my dilemna of wanting to learn enough to break into development in the computer industry.  From what I read, it was going to be very intense, but also very effective, and with a money back guarantee if I didn&rsquo;t get a relevent industry job paying $60,000 or more.  Steep price tag though.  Really steep.  And it has been going up.  I&rsquo;d noticed that they had a women&rsquo;s only Ruby on Rails bootcamp over the summer, but I just wasn&rsquo;t quite ready to commit when the deadline came (about a week after I&rsquo;d heard about them, I think).  But now, I think I&rsquo;m ready, so&hellip;</p>

<p>Today I finally took a big and scary step.  I wrote and submitted my application to CodeFellows for the Ruby on Rails bootcamp this late fall.  I took my time and gave thoughtful responses and felt pretty good about it.  Less than an hour later, I already had a response.  On a Friday late afternoon!</p>

<p>I had made it to the next round of the Bootcamp Application.</p>

<p>Now, I just have to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Put together a short YouTube video introducing myself and explaining something technical related to programming.</p></li>
<li><p>Submit a best-foot-forward code sample.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I am elated to have made it to the next round.  I am also eager and nervous about the next requirements.</p>

<p>Oooo.  I think I have a cool idea.  Off to see what I can work out.  Looks like the family will need to share me with technology this weekend.</p>

<h3>Code sample</h3>

<p>Code sample nearly complete.  I&rsquo;ve been checking into github all along the way.  It makes me feel a bit vulnerable to put the code out there while I&rsquo;m still working on it, but I will wait until I finish before I submit it officially.  Perhaps seeing how I put it together will give them more of a good impression that not.  I hope so.  I find myself being quite self conscious of my code.  My husband asked to take a look at it and has been pouring through it all afternoon&hellip;talk about self consciouness inducing.  Whew!</p>

<h3>Guessing my level</h3>

<p>I am very interested to see if I will qualify for the Silver or the Gold level of boot camp.  Gold means that I can skip the first month-long class and just take the second one.  It will be a lovely savings in time and money, so I am doing my best and we&rsquo;ll see how I rank.  The savings would be nice, but I am more interested in finding out where I place.  I find that sort of metric to be very interesting.  I&rsquo;m guessing that I rank about week 3 of 4 in the first month.  That would still mean that I need to take the first class too, but I&rsquo;ll have a very thorough review for the first week or so.  All to the good.  I could use a good portfolio of code snippets I&rsquo;ve written stored up on github for those code submissions that I&rsquo;ve been told companies are more interested in these days.</p>

<h3>Coding at the lake</h3>

<p>I had a lovely afternoon early this week having a picnic at Rattlesnake Lake with son, husband, and friend.  Perfect weather, not too hot, not too cold.  The others frolicked in the water, as I sat in the shade working out some snarls in my code.  Got all the code fixed that was broken.  Implemented additional code, some even worked right off.  All is unit tested.  Happy family.  Happy mama.</p>

<h3>Blueberries!</h3>

<p>Took another break yesterday morning to take son, husband, and friend blueberry picking at the local farm.  We came home with 16 pounds!  Reaped wonderful rewards at 2am while burning the midnight oil coding, as the smell of blueberry crumble wafted upstairs from the ambitious efforts of my brother&rsquo;s girlfriend.  Oh joy!  The merits of diligence to my work as well as taking time with my family.  I must be doing something right.</p>

<h3>Wrapup</h3>

<p>And now it is time to get back to figuring out that intro video.  I&rsquo;m taking a break from the code for the moment.  I&rsquo;ve done a lot over the last 24 hours, so I should give it a little bit of a rest before I leap in and implement that UI.</p>

<h3>Summer festival</h3>

<p>It is a beautiful, partly cloudy afternoon at the Festival at Mt Si here in my little home town.  I am ensconced on a blanket on the grass, leaning against a large tree in a thoroughly shady spot.  There is a nice breeze.  The band playing nearby is a pleasant backdrop to the pleasant murmur of neighbors and children enjoying a lovely summer afternoon.</p>

<h3>My community</h3>

<p>My free range son is running around, encountering friends, exhausting himself in the bouncy houses, and experiencing the thrill of a large climbing wall where a harness and helmet are required.  I feel pleasantly steeped in the community experience today.  I have chosen the right place to raise my family and spend the rest of my life.  The beauty of my surroundings is staggering.</p>

<h3>Coding</h3>

<p>And now, back to some more ruby coding.  I&rsquo;ve got to hurry up and finish that code for round two of the CodeFellows application.  I&rsquo;ve got a fun idea that has come together very well, so I am excited to get it ready for submission.</p>

<h3>Impostor Syndrome</h3>

<p>If only the code I just submitted might be good enough.</p>

<h3>Fretting</h3>

<p>So worried.  There is so much good that could come from this experience.</p>

<p>Will I get into Gold or need to take Silver as well?</p>

<p>So many questions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already committed myself to the process, but this event was a lovely opportunity to meet many of the ladies from the Code Fellows Ruby on Rails women only bootcamp.  It was nice to talk to women in the middle of the process to make sure I knew how to get ready for my own experience.  I&rsquo;m getting more and more excited.</p>

<h3>News!</h3>

<p>Two fretful weeks later, the news finally arrives.  My coding sample was accepted and I&rsquo;ve made it to the final step in the process&hellip;the 10 minute in-person interview.</p>

<p>Yikes!</p>

<p>I must not have done very well.  Had a hard time answering easy interview questions like what is a class vs a method.  What is MVC?  I feel so stupid when trying to answer these sorts of interview questions.  I stammer.  I get my technical terms mixed up.  I am going to need to practice these sorts of interview questions and get better at my technical glib.</p>

<p>More code samples!?</p>

<p>I have been assigned an additional final step.  Yep, I must not have done well in person.  Ok, I can do this.  I have 3 days for 3 assignments.  Some Ruby, some Rails, and some HTML.  Guess the family won&rsquo;t be enjoying my company this weekend.</p>

<p>Yikes!!!</p>
