<div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>  Still behind, but finding my rhythm.</p>

<p>  I&rsquo;m starting to find my balance with both the work and trying to keep up
with the basic things, you know, like eating, sleeping, clean clothes, that
sort of thing. All my spare time, and there isn&rsquo;t much, is for my family and
my little boy. We all seem to be doing all right, but I think he&rsquo;s paying the
highest price. It is hard for a child to, when they have enjoyed the luxury of
their parents home for nearly their first five years of life, now have ALL
of that change. To have mama working, to have papa working, to have uncle
working, and only one at home supporting the rest of us.</p>

<p>  In class, I feel like I&rsquo;m always behind, but I still feel like I&rsquo;m learning
very effective, and getting everything implemented successfully, but the
going, while thorough, is still slow.</p>

<p>  The good news is that the class project, where I&rsquo;m collaborating with
someone else, is something my husband and I have been wanting to do for a
very long time.  It&rsquo;s an idea that has been developing for a couple of years
now, and it ends up being so well tailored for this class as a demonstration
of our skills that I am a bit startled in just how appropriate it is. This
also means YAY! something to be ahead on, and we are. If we can keep up that
pattern, I think we may be able to catch up on everything.</p>

<p>  The class is still, as we like to call it at home, &lsquo;drinking from the
informational firehose&rsquo;. And it is hard not to choke. It is important to keep
panic at bay with good eating habits, lots of sleep, and stopping to take a
breath now and then.  To that end, this last weekend, I took my family to
GeekGirlCon. But husband and I spent as much time as we could with our noses
in our laptops. The environment was both distracting and encouraging. I got to
share with several people what CodeFellows was, since my costume was the same
professional wardrobe that I wear every day to class with my CodeFellows
t-shirt under my dress coat.</p>

<p>  I&rsquo;ve been to a number of conventions. Mostly science fiction, ComicCon,
WorldCon, only one or two professional conventions.  And this con was
unique. I have never felt so welcomed and so encouraged by every person I
met. I have also never seen that many women all getting their geek on.
Teaching.  Learning.  Encouraging.  Enthusing.  And all of them happy to
share. I have always undervalued the power of women working together and
supporting one another. Part of this journey is learning is learning how
important that is. And why I want to seek it out.  For myself and to nurture
it in others. I will not be missing another GeekGirlCon, and it is only in its
third year.  What an amazing force for good this convention is and will be.
I can only imagine that this convention is for geekdom what the Grace Hopper
Conference is for STEM.  I hope next year to attend Grace Hopper to find out
for myself.</p>

<p>Blog Notes: I tried to take the time during my commute daily to simply admire
autumn&rsquo;s beauty dripping its colors through the trees. The mists drift over
the waterways, sometimes shrouding my valley in white. And then a spear of
sunlight pierces the mists, striking in its contrast.s</p>
