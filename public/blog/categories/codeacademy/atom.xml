    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Ruby?</h3>

<p>Remembering a nudge towards Ruby Koans that I&rsquo;d been given by a friend and colleague a couple years back, I also remembered the fun I had exploring Ruby and how easy Ruby made things.  Ruby doesn&rsquo;t have the pain of memory allocation and pointers and string manipulation pain.  This seemed like something to investigate further, so I did a bit of research investigating online learning resources for Ruby.</p>

<h3>CodeAcademy</h3>

<p>I found CodeAcademy and spent most of April and May working my way through tier Ruby, JavaScript, and JQuery offerings.  Their lessons are pretty basic introductions, but are a fun introduction and free.  I hadn&rsquo;t really meant to do the JS and JQuery lessons, but the Ruby lesson was broken for a while.  I enjoyed the gamification of the coding lessons, where I could earn a personal high score in Points Today, Day Streak, Total Points, and Badges Completed.</p>

<h3>Coding!</h3>

<p>I was rapidly starting to believe that Ruby on Rails may well be a good and enjoyable start along my path towards my goal.</p>
