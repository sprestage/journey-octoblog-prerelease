    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is a beautiful, partly cloudy afternoon at the Festival at Mt Si here in my little home town.  I am ensconced on a blanket on the grass, leaning against a large tree in a thoroughly shady spot.  There is a nice breeze.  The band playing nearby is a pleasant backdrop to the pleasant murmur of my neighbors and their children enjoying a lovely summer afternoon.</p>

<p>My free range son is running around, encountering friends, exhausting himself in the bouncy houses, and experiencing the thrill of a large climbing wall where a harness and helmet are required.  I feel pleasantly steeped in the community experience today.  I have chosen the right place to raise my family and spend the rest of my life.  The beauty of my surroundings is staggering.</p>

<p>And now, back to some more ruby coding.  I&rsquo;ve got to hurry up and finish that code for round two of the CodeFellows application.  I&rsquo;ve got a fun idea that has come together very well, so I am excited to get it ready for submission.</p>
