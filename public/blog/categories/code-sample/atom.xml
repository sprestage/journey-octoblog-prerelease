<h3>Summer festival</h3>

<p>It is a beautiful, partly cloudy afternoon at the Festival at Mt Si here in my little home town.  I am ensconced on a blanket on the grass, leaning against a large tree in a thoroughly shady spot.  There is a nice breeze.  The band playing nearby is a pleasant backdrop to the pleasant murmur of neighbors and children enjoying a lovely summer afternoon.</p>

<h3>My community</h3>

<p>My free range son is running around, encountering friends, exhausting himself in the bouncy houses, and experiencing the thrill of a large climbing wall where a harness and helmet are required.  I feel pleasantly steeped in the community experience today.  I have chosen the right place to raise my family and spend the rest of my life.  The beauty of my surroundings is staggering.</p>

<h3>Coding</h3>

<p>And now, back to some more ruby coding.  I&rsquo;ve got to hurry up and finish that code for round two of the CodeFellows application.  I&rsquo;ve got a fun idea that has come together very well, so I am excited to get it ready for submission.</p>

<h3>Impostor Syndrome</h3>

<p>If only the code I just submitted might be good enough.</p>

<h3>Fretting</h3>

<p>So worried.  There is so much good that could come from this experience.</p>

<p>Will I get into Gold or need to take Silver as well?</p>

<p>So many questions.</p>

<h3>News!</h3>

<p>Two fretful weeks later, the news finally arrives.  My coding sample was accepted and I&rsquo;ve made it to the final step in the process&hellip;the 10 minute in-person interview.</p>

<p>Yikes!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whew!</p>

<p>3 code samples in 3 days.</p>

<p>Exhausting, but I made it.  GitHub was a good friend while I tried to keep forward momentum, while juggling my time and carefully progressing through each assignment.  I feel pretty good about the assignments.  They could be better, but isn&rsquo;t that what the bootcamp is for?</p>

<p>And now, more waiting.  Hopefully not too long, since I am on serious pins and needles here.</p>
