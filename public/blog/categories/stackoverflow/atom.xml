    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The month of May found me finishing up CodeAcademy and looking for something new.</p>

<h3>RailsTutorial</h3>

<p>Remembering some advice from the Seattle Rails event, I looked into Michael Hartl&rsquo;s online RailsTutorial.  I&rsquo;d been learning Ruby all this time, which is a programming language.  A particularly high level and weakly typed language.  Rails is a framework that is written in Ruby.  What I had not realized before now is that I&rsquo;d been using Rails back at my last job and so was already rather familiar with it.</p>

<h3>GitHub</h3>

<p>I also started my GitHub repository as a result of working through RailsTutorial.  I had no idea at the time just how important and heavily used that repo would become.  It makes me smile, looking back.</p>

<h3>StackOverflow</h3>

<p>I took about 2 months to work through RailsTutorial.  I really took my time so I would fully understand things as well as trying to work through the various exercises.  I first became familiar with StackOverflow at this time, since occasionally, syntax changes in newer versions of Ruby/Rails would cause proplems.  Goodness have I ended up becoming familiar with Stack Overflow over the last year as a Go To place for finding solutions to problems.  So far, I haven&rsquo;t answered a question nor posed a question of my own.  Impostor Syndrome or perfectionism has kept me from doing it so far as I want to be sure to get it just right.</p>
