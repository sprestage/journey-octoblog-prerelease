<h3>NorWesCon panels and coding</h3>

<p>Spring brought with it the local literary convention, NorWesCon.  There were several panels that got me thinking about women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math), networking within my industry, and how to re-find my passion in technology.  I decided it was time to pick back up my long abandoned pursuit of programming and to start networking with other women in technology for mutual support and growth.</p>

<h3>Networking with women</h3>

<p>Most of my social connections previously have been with men, so networking with women is a frightening notion for me.  I have long shied away from Ladies Nights Out as being very foreign and uncomfortable and not very applicable.  But, I needed to get out more and freshen my networking skills as a preparation for interviewing so I time to plunge forward right outside my comfort zone.</p>
