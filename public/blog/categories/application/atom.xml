<h3>Code Fellows</h3>

<p>Not sure where I found these folks initially.  I think I just kept stumbling over the name over and over.  It seemed like a rigorous but awesome solution to my dilemna of wanting to learn enough to break into development in the computer industry.  From what I read, it was going to be very intense, but also very effective, and with a money back guarantee if I didn&rsquo;t get a relevent industry job paying $60,000 or more.  Steep price tag though.  Really steep.  And it has been going up.  I&rsquo;d noticed that they had a women&rsquo;s only Ruby on Rails bootcamp over the summer, but I just wasn&rsquo;t quite ready to commit when the deadline came (about a week after I&rsquo;d heard about them, I think).  But now, I think I&rsquo;m ready, so&hellip;</p>

<h3>Preliminary application</h3>

<p>Today I finally took a big and scary step.  I wrote and submitted my application to CodeFellows for the Ruby on Rails bootcamp this late fall.  I took my time and gave thoughtful responses and felt pretty good about it.  Less than an hour later, I already had a response.  On a Friday late afternoon!</p>

<p>I had made it to the next round of the Bootcamp Application.</p>

<h3>Ruby on Rails bootcamp application assignment</h3>

<p>Now, I just have to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Put together a short YouTube video introducing myself and explaining something technical related to programming.</p></li>
<li><p>Submit a best-foot-forward code sample.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I am elated to have made it to the next round.  I am also eager and nervous about the next requirements.</p>

<p>Oooo.  I think I have a cool idea.  Off to see what I can work out.  Looks like the family will need to share me with technology this weekend.</p>

<h3>Code sample</h3>

<p>Code sample nearly complete.  I&rsquo;ve been checking into github all along the way.  It makes me feel a bit vulnerable to put the code out there while I&rsquo;m still working on it, but I will wait until I finish before I submit it officially.  Perhaps seeing how I put it together will give them more of a good impression that not.  I hope so.  I find myself being quite self conscious of my code.  My husband asked to take a look at it and has been pouring through it all afternoon&hellip;talk about self consciouness inducing.  Whew!</p>

<h3>Guessing my level</h3>

<p>I am very interested to see if I will qualify for the Silver or the Gold level of boot camp.  Gold means that I can skip the first month-long class and just take the second one.  It will be a lovely savings in time and money, so I am doing my best and we&rsquo;ll see how I rank.  The savings would be nice, but I am more interested in finding out where I place.  I find that sort of metric to be very interesting.  I&rsquo;m guessing that I rank about week 3 of 4 in the first month.  That would still mean that I need to take the first class too, but I&rsquo;ll have a very thorough review for the first week or so.  All to the good.  I could use a good portfolio of code snippets I&rsquo;ve written stored up on github for those code submissions that I&rsquo;ve been told companies are more interested in these days.</p>

<h3>Coding at the lake</h3>

<p>I had a lovely afternoon early this week having a picnic at Rattlesnake Lake with son, husband, and friend.  Perfect weather, not too hot, not too cold.  The others frolicked in the water, as I sat in the shade working out some snarls in my code.  Got all the code fixed that was broken.  Implemented additional code, some even worked right off.  All is unit tested.  Happy family.  Happy mama.</p>

<h3>Blueberries!</h3>

<p>Took another break yesterday morning to take son, husband, and friend blueberry picking at the local farm.  We came home with 16 pounds!  Reaped wonderful rewards at 2am while burning the midnight oil coding, as the smell of blueberry crumble wafted upstairs from the ambitious efforts of my brother&rsquo;s girlfriend.  Oh joy!  The merits of diligence to my work as well as taking time with my family.  I must be doing something right.</p>

<h3>Wrapup</h3>

<p>And now it is time to get back to figuring out that intro video.  I&rsquo;m taking a break from the code for the moment.  I&rsquo;ve done a lot over the last 24 hours, so I should give it a little bit of a rest before I leap in and implement that UI.</p>

<h3>Summer festival</h3>

<p>It is a beautiful, partly cloudy afternoon at the Festival at Mt Si here in my little home town.  I am ensconced on a blanket on the grass, leaning against a large tree in a thoroughly shady spot.  There is a nice breeze.  The band playing nearby is a pleasant backdrop to the pleasant murmur of neighbors and children enjoying a lovely summer afternoon.</p>

<h3>My community</h3>

<p>My free range son is running around, encountering friends, exhausting himself in the bouncy houses, and experiencing the thrill of a large climbing wall where a harness and helmet are required.  I feel pleasantly steeped in the community experience today.  I have chosen the right place to raise my family and spend the rest of my life.  The beauty of my surroundings is staggering.</p>

<h3>Coding</h3>

<p>And now, back to some more ruby coding.  I&rsquo;ve got to hurry up and finish that code for round two of the CodeFellows application.  I&rsquo;ve got a fun idea that has come together very well, so I am excited to get it ready for submission.</p>

<h3>Impostor Syndrome</h3>

<p>If only the code I just submitted might be good enough.</p>

<h3>Fretting</h3>

<p>So worried.  There is so much good that could come from this experience.</p>

<p>Will I get into Gold or need to take Silver as well?</p>

<p>So many questions.</p>

<h3>News!</h3>

<p>Two fretful weeks later, the news finally arrives.  My coding sample was accepted and I&rsquo;ve made it to the final step in the process&hellip;the 10 minute in-person interview.</p>

<p>Yikes!</p>
