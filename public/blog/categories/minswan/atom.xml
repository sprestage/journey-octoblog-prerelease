<h3>Seattle Rails community</h3>

<p>The Seattle Rails educational and networking meetup was an evening-long event with two technical talks, dinner, and networking.  I was pretty nervous going into this, since my programming skills are rusty at best, and I am completely new to Ruby.</p>

<h3>MINSWAN</h3>

<p>The Rails community, however, was very welcoming.  I felt encouraged and came away eager to continue forward learning Ruby and Rails as well as networking with folks in that community.  &ldquo;Matz is nice, so we are nice.&rdquo;  This is a phrase I learned at this event referring to the ruby language designer,  Mr. Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz).</p>
