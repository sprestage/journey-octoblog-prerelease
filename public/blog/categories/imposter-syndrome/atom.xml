    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>April 26th &amp; 27th, 2013</p>

<p>I joined several relevent local meetup groups and then I learned of She&rsquo;s Geeky 13, Seattle.  This is an un-conference for women geeks of all kinds to share, connect, network, learn, inspire, and enjoy (paraphrased from the She&rsquo;s Geeky website, shesgeeky.org).</p>

<h3>Impostor Syndrome</h3>

<p>I enjoyed panels on public speaking, mentoring, Ruby and online learning, and very importantly for me: Impostor Syndrome.  Oh that last one was an eye opener for me to be sure.  It explains a lot to me about why so many women in technology have a hard time putting themselves forward unless or until they are very sure of themselves.  It is very reassuring to me to know how many suffer from this and not all of them women either.</p>

<h3>A plan</h3>

<p>Attending this un-conference made all the difference in the world and confirmed the wisdom of my ideas.  I finalized my plan for re-purposing my career with the attendant studying, learning, networking needed over the next several months to change my career from being a 20 year software tester, to being a newby Ruby on Rails developer.</p>

<h3>A journey</h3>

<p>I came out of this experience realizing that I was on an amazing journey.  I also realized the importance of sharing my travels so that other people, particularly women, could see a path that could be taken, and that great change can be made by normal people.  Thanks to some encouragement I received during She&rsquo;s Geeky I saw the wisdom of writing about my experience, thus I first put &ldquo;pen&rdquo; to this blog of my journey on May 8, 2013.</p>

<p>Thank you, She&rsquo;s Geeky, for the inspiration, the encouragement, and the courage to give it all a try.  I can&rsquo;t wait until next time!</p>

<h3>Impostor Syndrome</h3>

<p>If only the code I just submitted might be good enough.</p>

<h3>Fretting</h3>

<p>So worried.  There is so much good that could come from this experience.</p>

<p>Will I get into Gold or need to take Silver as well?</p>

<p>So many questions.</p>
