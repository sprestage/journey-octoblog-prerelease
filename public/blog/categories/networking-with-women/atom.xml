    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, back to the plan to renew that passion and prepare for my reentry into the workforce.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>GeekGirlCon meetup: This is a meetup for the purpose of networking with other geeky women.  It seemed like a good first step to get me started on networking.
