    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>October 1, 2013</p>

<p>It is the final week of summer and I have spent these last couple of weeks before bootcamp preparing for having no time whatsoever for two months.  Catching up on sleep, spending special time enjoying the last bit of summer weather with my little boy, preparing and freezing casseroles to keep us fed, and doing the final preparations to get the ranch ready for the rainy season.</p>

<p>Busy, but happy domestic times with my ranch and my family.  I&rsquo;m pretty nervous about bootcamp, but have too much to do to prepare to waste too much time worrying.</p>

<h3>Grandparents!?</h3>

<p>Wait?!</p>

<p>What do you mean you are coming for a visit during the first week of bootcamp!  Well, when it rains, it pours.  At least they are coming during the <em>first</em> week.</p>
