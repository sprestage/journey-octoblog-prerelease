    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First, some history to know where I come from, technologically.</p>

<h3>Programming</h3>

<p>I discovered a passion for computers in a programming class I took in high school.  I gradual route through post-high school education finally took me to the University of California at Santa Cruz.  I initally planned to major in Computer Science, but when I discovered that they had a Computer Engineering progam when I could learn all about the hardware and still take programming classes as my upper division electives, I knew I&rsquo;d found the right program for me.  Years of hard work later saw me successfully graduated and employed in the computer industry as a software tester.</p>

<h3>Whoops, a job in test!</h3>

<p>I had initially planned to become a developer, but landed my first industry job at a startup that needed a tester immediately and I was the only one in their list willing to come in the very next day, a Saturday.  Yes, I had social plans, but the opportunity was not to be missed.</p>

<h3>Quality Engineering</h3>

<p>Several industry quality engineering positions later, I decided that I very much liked testing, as long as I was working very closely with the development process.  I wanted to be in on the design decisions and debug the specs (specifications) before they were implemented and it was too late.</p>

<h3>The decline</h3>

<p>Slowly the industry changed, turning quality engineers into SDETs and requiring automation of monolithic systems where it is hard to feel like your testing, your coding, or your opinions matter much.  I&rsquo;ve managed to avoid this side of the industry until now.  But now, it seems to be the standard.</p>

<h3>NorWesCon panels and coding</h3>

<p>Spring brought with it the local literary convention, NorWesCon.  There were several panels that got me thinking about women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math), networking within my industry, and how to re-find my passion in technology.  I decided it was time to pick back up my long abandoned pursuit of programming and to start networking with other women in technology for mutual support and growth.</p>

<h3>Networking with women</h3>

<p>Most of my social connections previously have been with men, so networking with women is a frightening notion for me.  I have long shied away from Ladies Nights Out as being very foreign and uncomfortable and not very applicable.  But, I needed to get out more and freshen my networking skills as a preparation for interviewing so I time to plunge forward right outside my comfort zone.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Ruby?</h3>

<p>Remembering a nudge towards Ruby Koans that I&rsquo;d been given by a friend and colleague a couple years back, I also remembered the fun I had exploring Ruby and how easy Ruby made things.  Ruby doesn&rsquo;t have the pain of memory allocation and pointers and string manipulation pain.  This seemed like something to investigate further, so I did a bit of research investigating online learning resources for Ruby.</p>

<h3>CodeAcademy</h3>

<p>I found CodeAcademy and spent most of April and May working my way through tier Ruby, JavaScript, and JQuery offerings.  Their lessons are pretty basic introductions, but are a fun introduction and free.  I hadn&rsquo;t really meant to do the JS and JQuery lessons, but the Ruby lesson was broken for a while.  I enjoyed the gamification of the coding lessons, where I could earn a personal high score in Points Today, Day Streak, Total Points, and Badges Completed.</p>

<h3>Coding!</h3>

<p>I was rapidly starting to believe that Ruby on Rails may well be a good and enjoyable start along my path towards my goal.</p>
