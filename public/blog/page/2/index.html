  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>The month of May found me finishing up CodeAcademy and looking for something new.</p>

<h3>RailsTutorial</h3>

<p>Remembering some advice from the Seattle Rails event, I looked into Michael Hartl&rsquo;s online RailsTutorial.  I&rsquo;d been learning Ruby all this time, which is a programming language.  A particularly high level and weakly typed language.  Rails is a framework that is written in Ruby.  What I had not realized before now is that I&rsquo;d been using Rails back at my last job and so was already rather familiar with it.</p>

<h3>GitHub</h3>

<p>I also started my GitHub repository as a result of working through RailsTutorial.  I had no idea at the time just how important and heavily used that repo would become.  It makes me smile, looking back.</p>

<h3>StackOverflow</h3>

<p>I took about 2 months to work through RailsTutorial.  I really took my time so I would fully understand things as well as trying to work through the various exercises.  I first became familiar with StackOverflow at this time, since occasionally, syntax changes in newer versions of Ruby/Rails would cause proplems.  Goodness have I ended up becoming familiar with Stack Overflow over the last year as a Go To place for finding solutions to problems.  So far, I haven&rsquo;t answered a question nor posed a question of my own.  Impostor Syndrome or perfectionism has kept me from doing it so far as I want to be sure to get it just right.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>July 17-21, 2013</p>

<h3>Family vacation</h3>

<p>Something I haven&rsquo;t been mentioning too much yet is the importance of taking time for yourself and for your family.  It can be a lot of effort in logistics and preparation, but going away with my family and putting most of our every day responsibilities aside for a time can be a wonderful way to relax and reconnect.</p>

<h3>Summer camp</h3>

<p>Some of the family is involved in a martial art.  The art has a summer camp every year that is an extended weekend campout at a beautiful lake on the Olympic peninsula.  The participants organize into little workshops or hikes on the days leading up to the last day when all gather for the summer Belt Test.</p>

<h3>Family time</h3>

<p>I am fortunate that this is an event that is looked forward to by the whole family.  We keep it pretty civilized though by staying in an RV.  We like our hot showers and easy cooking facilities, not to mention the espresso machine and power for our devices.  I mean really, how would I blog without power?  Still, much of the time is spent together around the campfire, swimming, hiking, or playing games.</p>

<h3>Mostly peaceful</h3>

<p>The weather was lovely.  The company was good.  Swimming in the lake was divine.  Our little boy had such a good time, with a possible exception of one late night when his tummy decided ENOUGH!.  Ah well, I managed to get Everything cleaned up in the Rented RV after only 2 or 3 hours.  Poor little guy.  Poor mama.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>July 26th, 2013</p>

<h3>Code Fellows</h3>

<p>Not sure where I found these folks initially.  I think I just kept stumbling over the name over and over.  It seemed like a rigorous but awesome solution to my dilemna of wanting to learn enough to break into development in the computer industry.  From what I read, it was going to be very intense, but also very effective, and with a money back guarantee if I didn&rsquo;t get a relevent industry job paying $60,000 or more.  Steep price tag though.  Really steep.  And it has been going up.  I&rsquo;d noticed that they had a women&rsquo;s only Ruby on Rails bootcamp over the summer, but I just wasn&rsquo;t quite ready to commit when the deadline came (about a week after I&rsquo;d heard about them, I think).  But now, I think I&rsquo;m ready, so&hellip;</p>

<h3>Preliminary application</h3>

<p>Today I finally took a big and scary step.  I wrote and submitted my application to CodeFellows for the Ruby on Rails bootcamp this late fall.  I took my time and gave thoughtful responses and felt pretty good about it.  Less than an hour later, I already had a response.  On a Friday late afternoon!</p>

<p>I had made it to the next round of the Bootcamp Application.</p>

<h3>Ruby on Rails bootcamp application assignment</h3>

<p>Now, I just have to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Put together a short YouTube video introducing myself and explaining something technical related to programming.</p></li>
<li><p>Submit a best-foot-forward code sample.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I am elated to have made it to the next round.  I am also eager and nervous about the next requirements.</p>

<p>Oooo.  I think I have a cool idea.  Off to see what I can work out.  Looks like the family will need to share me with technology this weekend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>August 1st, 2013</p>

<h3>Code sample</h3>

<p>Code sample nearly complete.  I&rsquo;ve been checking into github all along the way.  It makes me feel a bit vulnerable to put the code out there while I&rsquo;m still working on it, but I will wait until I finish before I submit it officially.  Perhaps seeing how I put it together will give them more of a good impression that not.  I hope so.  I find myself being quite self conscious of my code.  My husband asked to take a look at it and has been pouring through it all afternoon&hellip;talk about self consciouness inducing.  Whew!</p>

<h3>Guessing my level</h3>

<p>I am very interested to see if I will qualify for the Silver or the Gold level of boot camp.  Gold means that I can skip the first month-long class and just take the second one.  It will be a lovely savings in time and money, so I am doing my best and we&rsquo;ll see how I rank.  The savings would be nice, but I am more interested in finding out where I place.  I find that sort of metric to be very interesting.  I&rsquo;m guessing that I rank about week 3 of 4 in the first month.  That would still mean that I need to take the first class too, but I&rsquo;ll have a very thorough review for the first week or so.  All to the good.  I could use a good portfolio of code snippets I&rsquo;ve written stored up on github for those code submissions that I&rsquo;ve been told companies are more interested in these days.</p>

<h3>Coding at the lake</h3>

<p>I had a lovely afternoon early this week having a picnic at Rattlesnake Lake with son, husband, and friend.  Perfect weather, not too hot, not too cold.  The others frolicked in the water, as I sat in the shade working out some snarls in my code.  Got all the code fixed that was broken.  Implemented additional code, some even worked right off.  All is unit tested.  Happy family.  Happy mama.</p>

<h3>Blueberries!</h3>

<p>Took another break yesterday morning to take son, husband, and friend blueberry picking at the local farm.  We came home with 16 pounds!  Reaped wonderful rewards at 2am while burning the midnight oil coding, as the smell of blueberry crumble wafted upstairs from the ambitious efforts of my brother&rsquo;s girlfriend.  Oh joy!  The merits of diligence to my work as well as taking time with my family.  I must be doing something right.</p>

<h3>Wrapup</h3>

<p>And now it is time to get back to figuring out that intro video.  I&rsquo;m taking a break from the code for the moment.  I&rsquo;ve done a lot over the last 24 hours, so I should give it a little bit of a rest before I leap in and implement that UI.</p>

<h3>Summer festival</h3>

<p>It is a beautiful, partly cloudy afternoon at the Festival at Mt Si here in my little home town.  I am ensconced on a blanket on the grass, leaning against a large tree in a thoroughly shady spot.  There is a nice breeze.  The band playing nearby is a pleasant backdrop to the pleasant murmur of neighbors and children enjoying a lovely summer afternoon.</p>

<h3>My community</h3>

<p>My free range son is running around, encountering friends, exhausting himself in the bouncy houses, and experiencing the thrill of a large climbing wall where a harness and helmet are required.  I feel pleasantly steeped in the community experience today.  I have chosen the right place to raise my family and spend the rest of my life.  The beauty of my surroundings is staggering.</p>

<h3>Coding</h3>

<p>And now, back to some more ruby coding.  I&rsquo;ve got to hurry up and finish that code for round two of the CodeFellows application.  I&rsquo;ve got a fun idea that has come together very well, so I am excited to get it ready for submission.</p>

<h3>Impostor Syndrome</h3>

<p>If only the code I just submitted might be good enough.</p>

<h3>Fretting</h3>

<p>So worried.  There is so much good that could come from this experience.</p>

<p>Will I get into Gold or need to take Silver as well?</p>

<p>So many questions.</p>

<h3>Seattle Girl Geek Dinner</h3>

<h4>sponsored by Code Fellows</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already committed myself to the process, but this event was a lovely opportunity to meet many of the ladies from the Code Fellows Ruby on Rails women only bootcamp.  It was nice to talk to women in the middle of the process to make sure I knew how to get ready for my own experience.  I&rsquo;m getting more and more excited.</p>

<h3>The interview</h3>

<p>I must not have done very well.  Had a hard time answering easy interview questions like what is a class vs a method.  What is MVC?  I feel so stupid when trying to answer these sorts of interview questions.  I stammer.  I get my technical terms mixed up.  I am going to need to practice these sorts of interview questions and get better at my technical glib.</p>

<p>Yikes!!!</p>
