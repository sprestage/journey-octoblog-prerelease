  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>November 10th, 2013</p>

<p>Oh.  Em.  Gee.</p>

<p>We made it.</p>

<p>Listening around the work tables at CodeFellows this week, as we were all
working on our class projects, I started hearing other people saying little things that suggested to me that I was not the only one scared, behind, and terrified that I was not going to pass Silver. They did not say it in so many words, but I heard a lot of worry. Of course, what I saw when I looked at their screens was a level of polish that made made my knees quake with, yeah, you guessed it, Impostor Syndrome. But the words I was hearing, the furrowed brows I was seeing, the increasingly frazzled appearances, suggested to me that these, my peers, might be in the same boat I was.</p>

<p>Today was the day. One PM was code freeze. Ivan sounded the gong at exactly one, over and over, and shooed us all downstairs to present Our Projects. I made sure, over the last two days, to keep an eye on the look
and feel of our project, knowing that just functionality is important, too, but dropping design on the floor would be a mistake. I came into today very nervous, but a little bit hopeful, because I was proud of our little site. It looked good. It made me feel good to look at it. And that helped, giving me just that tiniest bit of courage with which I stepped forward and presented&hellip;</p>

<p>first.</p>

<p><em>cue dramatic music</em></p>

<p>The presentation went well. I felt good and confidant about what I was speaking of. My partner was the same. I had enough to show off that I didn&rsquo;t even cover everything. I talked knowledgely about the design decisions we made. And humourously about points of pain, confusion,
and trouble. And my audience seemed engaged and interested. I finished up
feeling&hellip; pleased. And excited. And exhausted. The other presentations of my fellows seemed comperable in areas of strength, areas of weakness, areas of pain, and areas of joyful technological discovery. All different, as different people think differently and have different interests. But my fellow bootcampers finally felt like peers. We had suffered together and we had all, to a one, emerged triumphant.</p>

<p>There was a social afterwards. With the usual libations, offered as we
shuffled desks around, since another class had just completed and a new one had just started. The comaradarie and exhuberant energy, as well as the occasional flat affect of mental and physical exhaustion abounded. I felt an equal with these twenty other people at last. Even as recently as yesterday, I would not quite have felt comfortable tapping any one of them for technical help. Now, I feel like I could speak up at a tablefull and say &lsquo;Hey, does anyone know how to help with this?&rsquo; Not the sort of thing I do easily. So this is a big point of growth for me. And a warm relief.</p>

<p>I still feel like I could take a month between silver and gold to finish and wrap up all the learnings and projects and code samples that I want to write. And I will, but it looks like it will be <em>after</em> gold.</p>

<p>YAY I MADE IT TO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLD.</p>

<p>And now, as I commute home, in the autumn dusk, I bask in the beauty of the random patterns of the clouds, the soft colors of the sunset, framing the beautiful spectacle of Mount Rainer, and enjoy this moment of triumph and peace before I leap into it all again on Monday.</p>

<p>And now I go home to spend a lovely weekend with son, family, ranch, and
sleep.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Wednesday the 6th of November, 2013  8:02 am</p>

<p>So, late last week, one of our instructors was commenting about how one of
the founders of seattle.rb, Ryan Davis, had been bugging him to make
attending the next seattle.rb meetup and presenting either a lightning talk or our class projects a required assignment for everyone in class.</p>

<p>Thank you, Ryan. /sarcasm</p>

<p>Well, Ivan kindly did not make this mandatory, yet, seeing the wisdom, in
spite of my fears (and I assure you, they were plenty), my partner and I
presented our class project  So the next day, I got on to the seattle.rb site and signed us up  The attendance was enormous, apparently about three times their norm. But that&rsquo;s what you get when you nag CodeFellows and the Ada Academy to attend; well, there&rsquo;s a lot of us.</p>

<p>It was absolutely delightful to meet the women from the Ada Academy. The
Ada Academy is a year-long program for women who want to be developers but
have little to absolutely no experience in most cases. I got to bring out
several of my pet hobbyhorses, much to their entertainment; impostor syndrome, the hard work and hard won skill that is networking (meaning going to these meetings and interacting with <em>gasp</em> humans. New ones! That you don&rsquo;t already know!). It was flattering to realize that listening in the background was Carrie Miller, one of the founders/teachers/somethingorother of the Ada Academy. Carrie is a strong leader for women in technology. Her name and face keep coming across my screen, usually through devchicks, but other places, too, where good conversations are happening about the challenges women face in technology, particularly the computer industry. It was a pleasure to later
meet her and speak with her further about the Ada Academy.</p>

<p>The presentation went well.  The Adas in particular were a very appreciative audience and took the time later to say how much they enjoyed it.  I went home exhausted, it being several hours after my usual bedtime, but feeling strong in the path I&rsquo;ve chosen and where it&rsquo;s taking me.</p>
