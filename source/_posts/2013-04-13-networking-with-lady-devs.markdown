I chose a couple of venues to start with, both online and in person.

###DevChix
Online, there is DevChix.  This is a women's only group where I find women encouraging other women in technology, talking to each other about various social or technical challenges in the industry, and almost anything else a woman who programs might like to discuss.  I highly recommend this Google group.

###CodeChix
I must give a huge shout out to Shaili Guru of the Seattle chapter of CodeChix.  I started out just attending a little C# introduction held at the library.  I have since attended a number of events held by CodeChix and have had my best networking experiences there.  I've also met some of my favorite companies with whom I later enjoyed excellent interviews at CodeChix events.  This group seems mostly based in Silicon Valley, with a good chapter in Seattle, a website, and meetup groups by city.

###Women Who Code, Seattle
This international group started in 2011 and has been spreading.  The Seattle chapter started in November 2013 and already is approaching 400 members.  Such a neat experience walking into a room of 60 women, all of whom write code.  They have a website, a newsletter, and meetup groups by city.  I've found the newsletter very useful to discover events I haven't found anywhere else, such as one of Google's Women in Technology events.
