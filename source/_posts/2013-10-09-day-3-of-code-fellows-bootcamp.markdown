8 am, October 9th, 2013

They told us the first day not to stay up late doing our work. Get up early, sure, but don't stay up late. It was Day 2 of bootcamp, and I already felt like I was struggling with the load. I stayed up until 1 am, I got it all done, and then I started Day 3 four hours later.

In those early morning hours today at home, I broke down and lost it. I'm scared that I'm going to struggle and try and not be able to learn enough, quickly enough, to get through bootcamp. CodeFellows is a fellowship of professionals and I'm scared that they're going to take away my t-shirt. And what I mean by that is if I am struggling so much after only two days, how can it be that I belong in this class of amazing learners.

And so I will document this struggle and I will share my pain with you.

Because, dammit, if I can get through this and succeed you can, too.

Now if I can just hold it together long enough to get through Day 3 of class.  One day at a time.

NOTE Meticulous attention to detail may be setting me up to lose.

NOTE I am deeply comforted by my husband's understanding of what I'm going through.

NOTE I will need to be very careful of how much of my struggle I show to my young son.  Not so much that he is burdened with adult worries, but enough so that he sees examples of struggle, persistance, and (grace under pressure)

NOTE There is a lovely autumn mist over my home today. As I commute in to my beautiful chosen city, I am reminded of how glad I am of my home and the choices I've made.

NOTE Take deep breaths.
