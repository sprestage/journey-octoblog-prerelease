Whew!

3 code samples in 3 days.

Exhausting, but I made it.  GitHub was a good friend while I tried to keep forward momentum, while juggling my time and carefully progressing through each assignment.  I feel pretty good about the assignments.  They could be better, but isn't that what the bootcamp is for?

And now, more waiting.  Hopefully not too long, since I am on serious pins and needles here.
