###First day of class

Kai is a very worried little boy.  He seems worried that Papa and I are going away for the next two months.  We tried to reassure him on the way to class, but there is so much we do not yet know about our schedule that I fear we didn't reassure him very well.  As we drove away, Papa and I commited to each other to give Kai some very focused time with each of us every evening.

I think it will be very important to focus on my family in the evenings.  This seems very in sync with the advice from out instructors, in that they emphasized not staying up late coding, but instead to prioritize getting enough sleep.  Good plan.

Only one other lady in the class.  Makes sense, since they alternate with a ladies only class, so most women probably attend that one.  I could see how intimidating this would be for many women.  It is awesome that they have the choice available.  I'm used to this kind of percentage though, since I had the same ratios at university studying for my Computer Engineering (hardware) degree.
