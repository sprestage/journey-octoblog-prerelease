Hello old friends.  Hello new friends.  Hello colleagues.  Hello young learners.  Hello respected professionals.  I am the GeekyMamaMare.  Welcome to my blog.

Please enjoy sharing my journey of re-discovering my passion in technology and re-directing (re-purposing?) my career from software testing to software development.  A wordy intro statement indeed, but very relevant to my journey as you will see in time.  Let's start by looking at the dilemna I found myself in.

I had been a quality engineer in the computer industry for 20 years, when, in the summer of 2011, my dream job fell through my hands.  I was devastated.  I quickly realized that I was far too emotionally fragile for the moment and needed to take some time away from the industry to recover from my heart ache.

A year passed and I refreshed my resume and leapt back into the job search.  I had been fortunate in the past that each job came along just as it was needed, usually through networking, and generally right along the lines of where I wanted my career to go.  This time it was a different experience.  None of the jobs available seemed to be a good fit for my skills or my experience.  I also was beginning to discover a lack of motivation in my search.  It was as if my passion for technology and computers was missing.

I took a bit of time to figure out my priorities and what made me eager to go to work in the morning, only to discover that I really wasn't seeing anything available in the job market that made me eager to leave my family, my son, my ranch, and my horses in the morning.

My new goals started to come clear.

I wanted to renew my passion for technology such that I could find a company to contribute to that made me as eager to head to the office in the morning as I was to return to my beloved ranch in the evening.

Ok, good goal.  Now to develop a plan to take me towards that goal.
