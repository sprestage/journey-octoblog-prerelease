April 26th & 27th, 2013

I came out of this experience realizing that I was on an amazing journey.  I also realized the importance of sharing my travels so that other people, particularly women, could see a path that could be taken, and that great change can be made by normal people.  I first put "pen" to this blog of my journey on May 8, 2013.
