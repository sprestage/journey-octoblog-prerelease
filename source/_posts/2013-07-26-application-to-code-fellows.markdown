Today I finally took a big and scary step.  I wrote and submitted my application to CodeFellows for the Ruby on Rails bootcamp this late fall.  I took my time and gave thoughtful responses and felt pretty good about it.  Less than an hour later, I already had a response.  On a Friday late afternoon!

I had made it to the next round of the Bootcamp Application.

Now, I just had to:

	1. Put together a short YouTube video introducing myself and explaining something technical related to programming.

	2. Submit a best-foot-forward code sample.

I am elated to have made it to the next round.  I am also eager and nervous about the next requirements.  Oooo.  I think I
have a cool idea.  Off to see what I can work out.  Looks like the family will need to share me with technology this weekend.
