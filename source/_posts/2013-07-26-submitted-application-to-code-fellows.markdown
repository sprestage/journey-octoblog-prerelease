###Code Fellows
Not sure where I found these folks initially.  I think I just kept stumbling over the name over and over.  It seemed like a rigorous but awesome solution to my dilemna of wanting to learn enough to break into development in the computer industry.  From what I read, it was going to be very intense, but also very effective, and with a money back guarantee if I didn't get a relevent industry job paying $60,000 or more.  Steep price tag though.  Really steep.  And it has been going up.  I'd noticed that they had a women's only Ruby on Rails bootcamp over the summer, but I just wasn't quite ready to commit when the deadline came (about a week after I'd heard about them, I think).  But now, I think I'm ready, so...

###Preliminary application
Today I finally took a big and scary step.  I wrote and submitted my application to CodeFellows for the Ruby on Rails bootcamp this late fall.  I took my time and gave thoughtful responses and felt pretty good about it.  Less than an hour later, I already had a response.  On a Friday late afternoon!

I had made it to the next round of the Bootcamp Application.

###Ruby on Rails bootcamp application assignment
Now, I just have to:

1. Put together a short YouTube video introducing myself and explaining something technical related to programming.

2. Submit a best-foot-forward code sample.

I am elated to have made it to the next round.  I am also eager and nervous about the next requirements.

Oooo.  I think I have a cool idea.  Off to see what I can work out.  Looks like the family will need to share me with technology this weekend.
