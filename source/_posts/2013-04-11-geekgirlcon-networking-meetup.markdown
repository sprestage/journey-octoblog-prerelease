This was the first in my networking event line up.  A meetup for the purpose of networking with other geeky women.  It seemed like a good first step to get me started on networking.  I was very nervous going into this, since this sort of thing is way outside of my comfort zone.  Ok, deep breath, I can do this.

It turned out that these are good and friendly folk.  We were all mostly new, but that helped somewhat.  I introduced myself to a number of folks and worked on those introduction sorts of conversations.  Some were more successful that others.  I'm glad I went.  This was a good training event in how to network.
