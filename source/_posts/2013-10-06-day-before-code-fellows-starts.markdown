Very nervous today.  CodeFellows starts tomorrow.  I'm working out my nerves by thoroughly clearning several rooms in the house, knowing that this sort of thing will fall by the wayside for the next two months.

I've got my laptop backed up, upgraded to OSX 10.8, and made sure everything still works.

My beloved boy is all sorts of worried and stressed by the changes we've warned him are coming.

Time to get some good sleep before the adventure starts in the morning.
