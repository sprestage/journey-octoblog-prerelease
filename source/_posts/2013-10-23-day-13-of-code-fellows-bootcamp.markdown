I sacrificed sleep last night.  Well, not last night, but this
morning.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it.  I'm still feeling dreadfully behind, which is to say I'm still one week behind.  Just like last week, when I was... one week behind.  Which means I'm not falling futher behind. There's some merit there. There are fewer and fewer questions coming up in class lecture. The questions also seem entirely based around the most current material. During my early morning midnght oil burning, I came to the suspicion that far more of my classmates are just as thoroughly behind and are feeling just as awkward about asking questions as a result. Mostly I don't have a question for my instructors because as I am progressing, I no sooner come up with a question than I shortly discover the answer and move on to the next bit of learning.  Repeat, slowly, a lot. I feel pretty good about the things I'm learning, but then the instructors asks one of those questions in class. One of those perfect interview questions.  Something very fundamental to the understanding to the understanding of Ruby or Rails or object-oriented programming, and I watch the entire class flail helplessly, along with myself, as we struggle for the words or concepts and a means to express them.   They told us early on that they did not select us for the class because of how smart we were.  We were chosen for this class because of how hard we work and how hard we try. OH BOY do I hope that's true.  If it is, then I will make it through.  Somehow.  One step at a time.  If not, well, I was doomed from the outset.  So, no need to stress, just need to do.  And do.  And do.

And maybe catch up on a little sleep this weekend.
