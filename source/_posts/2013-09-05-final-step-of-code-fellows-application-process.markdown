###News!
Two fretful weeks later, the news finally arrives.  My coding sample was accepted and I've made it to the final step in the process...the 10 minute in-person interview.

Yikes!

###The interview
I must not have done very well.  Had a hard time answering easy interview questions like what is a class vs a method.  What is MVC?

###More code
I have been assigned an additional final step.  Yep, I must not have done well in person.  Ok, I can do this.  I have 3 days for 3 assignments.  Some Ruby, some Rails, and some HTML.  Guess the family won't be enjoying my company this weekend.
