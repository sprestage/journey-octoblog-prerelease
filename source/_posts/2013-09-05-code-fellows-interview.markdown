I must not have done very well.  Had a hard time answering easy interview questions like what is a class vs a method.  What is MVC?  I feel so stupid when trying to answer these sorts of interview questions.  I stammer.  I get my technical terms mixed up.  I am going to need to practice these sorts of interview questions and get better at my technical glib.
