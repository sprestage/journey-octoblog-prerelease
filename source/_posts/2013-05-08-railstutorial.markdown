The month of May found me finishing up CodeAcademy and looking for something new.

###RailsTutorial
Remembering some advice from the Seattle Rails event, I looked into Michael Hartl's online RailsTutorial.  I'd been learning Ruby all this time, which is a programming language.  A particularly high level and weakly typed language.  Rails is a framework that is written in Ruby.  What I had not realized before now is that I'd been using Rails back at my last job and so was already rather familiar with it.

###GitHub
I also started my GitHub repository as a result of working through RailsTutorial.  I had no idea at the time just how important and heavily used that repo would become.  It makes me smile, looking back.

###StackOverflow
I took about 2 months to work through RailsTutorial.  I really took my time so I would fully understand things as well as trying to work through the various exercises.  I first became familiar with StackOverflow at this time, since occasionally, syntax changes in newer versions of Ruby/Rails would cause proplems.  Goodness have I ended up becoming familiar with Stack Overflow over the last year as a Go To place for finding solutions to problems.  So far, I haven't answered a question nor posed a question of my own.  Impostor Syndrome or perfectionism has kept me from doing it so far as I want to be sure to get it just right.
