It still feels ilke drinking from the firehose, and I still feel like in
some ways I'm way behind. But what I am learning is amazing. I am learning so many things, so many tools, so many ways of thinking and I am absolutely loving it. I've been in industry, what I am learning is incredibly relevant to what you do and what you use EVERY day.

I've recovered my strength. Sleep is important! So is good And frequent
Nutrition.

I'm still behind and don't know how I'm going to catch up, but in some ways, I'm right with the class or even at the forefront in some of the work, so I am encouraged.

I would absolutely do this again, and very much believe that I am on the
right path. I think about what I used to do in my job and it still shuts me down inside, and now I think about what I'm doing with a smile on my face and a spring in my step, even at home, staring off in the distance, musing about some little change I want to make in my portfolio.  This is the passion I want I see in my day to day career, and I could not be more pleased that it is back.
