*said in a measuredly quiet voice*

don't.  panic.

I feel like I'm so far behind that the natural human tendancy makes me want to panic. It makes me want to panic, makes me want to dither, makes me want to run screaming off into the night.  I can't do that. It is too important that I stay the course, that I stay on task.

(yay carpools)

I've thought of some additional resources at my fingertips, and I'm going to start using those more, as well. And the important thing is that I don't let that gibbering thing inside me take over.  Instead, I need to see what I've done, identify the piece I don't understand, wrap it up and put it aside, and move on to the next thing. I need to stare at the screen reading documentation less; it's not getting me very far. A little of it, certainly, but after the third reading, I should start questioning. Code School's Rails for Zombies and the RailCasts have a lot of good resoures. Taking a half or even an hour out to learn more through one of those means won't take a lot away from what I'm accomplishing and can instead help me go forward by leaps and bounds. If I'd only pursued that a bit sooner, I'd be a lot further along. Ah well, the perfection of hindsight.

I learned long ago to just keep putting one foot in front of the other, so  that, at least, if you do fall, you'll fall in the correct direction. And that's making progress, too, right?

I'm at the point where I'm thinking code almost every minute of the day. I
chew on it in my dreams, I wake up wanting to sit down at my computer and
work on this or that. And I go to bed early with my son exausted and wishing I had more resources. The whole family is showing signs of the draining fatigue from this amazing experience. The price is very high for all of us, but we are all committed and pulling together for the benefits to us all will be enduring and worth it. And to be honest, the day-by-day experience is worth it.  Exhausting as hell, but worth it.  And I remember that, most of the time.
