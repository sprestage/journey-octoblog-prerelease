###Ruby?
Remembering a nudge towards Ruby Koans that I'd been given by a friend and colleague a couple years back, I also remembered the fun I had exploring Ruby and how easy Ruby made things.  Ruby doesn't have the pain of memory allocation and pointers and string manipulation pain.  This seemed like something to investigate further, so I did a bit of research investigating online learning resources for Ruby.

###CodeAcademy
I found CodeAcademy and spent most of April and May working my way through tier Ruby, JavaScript, and JQuery offerings.  Their lessons are pretty basic introductions, but are a fun introduction and free.  I hadn't really meant to do the JS and JQuery lessons, but the Ruby lesson was broken for a while.  I enjoyed the gamification of the coding lessons, where I could earn a personal high score in Points Today, Day Streak, Total Points, and Badges Completed.

###Coding!
I was rapidly starting to believe that Ruby on Rails may well be a good and enjoyable start along my path towards my goal.
