###Summer festival
It is a beautiful, partly cloudy afternoon at the Festival at Mt Si here in my little home town.  I am ensconced on a blanket on the grass, leaning against a large tree in a thoroughly shady spot.  There is a nice breeze.  The band playing nearby is a pleasant backdrop to the pleasant murmur of neighbors and children enjoying a lovely summer afternoon.

###My community
My free range son is running around, encountering friends, exhausting himself in the bouncy houses, and experiencing the thrill of a large climbing wall where a harness and helmet are required.  I feel pleasantly steeped in the community experience today.  I have chosen the right place to raise my family and spend the rest of my life.  The beauty of my surroundings is staggering.

###Coding
And now, back to some more ruby coding.  I've got to hurry up and finish that code for round two of the CodeFellows application.  I've got a fun idea that has come together very well, so I am excited to get it ready for submission.
