So, late last week, one of our instructors was commenting about how one of
the founders of seattle.rb, Ryan Davis, had been bugging him to make
attending the next seattle.rb meetup and presenting either a lightning talk or our class projects a required assignment for everyone in class.

Thank you, Ryan. /sarcasm

Well, Ivan kindly did not make this mandatory, yet, seeing the wisdom, in
spite of my fears (and I assure you, they were plenty), my partner and I
presented our class project  So the next day, I got on to the seattle.rb site and signed us up  The attendance was enormous, apparently about three times their norm. But that's what you get when you nag CodeFellows and the Ada Academy to attend; well, there's a lot of us.

It was absolutely delightful to meet the women from the Ada Academy. The
Ada Academy is a year-long program for women who want to be developers but
have little to absolutely no experience in most cases. I got to bring out
several of my pet hobbyhorses, much to their entertainment; impostor syndrome, the hard work and hard won skill that is networking (meaning going to these meetings and interacting with *gasp* humans. New ones! That you don't already know!). It was flattering to realize that listening in the background was Carrie Miller, one of the founders/teachers/somethingorother of the Ada Academy. Carrie is a strong leader for women in technology. Her name and face keep coming across my screen, usually through devchicks, but other places, too, where good conversations are happening about the challenges women face in technology, particularly the computer industry. It was a pleasure to later
meet her and speak with her further about the Ada Academy.

The presentation went well.  The Adas in particular were a very appreciative audience and took the time later to say how much they enjoyed it.  I went home exhausted, it being several hours after my usual bedtime, but feeling strong in the path I've chosen and where it's taking me.
