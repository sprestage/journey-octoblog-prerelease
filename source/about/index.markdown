I am the Geeky Mama Mare. Welcome to my blog.

I am on a journey to re-find my passion in technology and in my career. I spent 20 years testing software in the computer industry, but after losing a dream job, I discovered I’d lost my love and inspiration in technology. I felt lost and frightened and confused. I have long identified myself as an engineer and have an eager love of things geeky. How could I have lost my way?

Thus began a time of self discovery and learning. Along the way I have learned to network with and support other women, especially those in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). I’m still learning to grow past my anxiety in socializing with those of my own gender. There has been and will be a great deal of hard work and time needed to effectively learn and apply my new skills. But I have just come back from one of the scariest times of my life with purpose and excitement; this gives me hope and the strength I will need.

I would like to share with you the stories of what brought me to taking this journey. I want to share the steps I’m taking along my way down this path of change. It can be scary to alter the course of one’s life so directly. I hope to show that it can be done and that I am not an imposter for wanting to make these changes in my life. I am scared but tentatively finding a great deal of power in what I am doing and I want to share that so others can believe in their own power for change.

I went into this journey sure of 3 things. My perpetual delight in my horses and my ranch. My love for my son and my family. And my continued passion for technology, even though I wasn’t seeing it in my career. These things all contribute to all that I do, so these will also be colorful features here in my blog. Enjoy your time here.
